0.11 Wed Jul  7 04:33:58 PDT 1999
        *** IMPORTANT CHANGES ***
        This release includes a few changes which break
        backward compatibility.  Please read about them before
        deciding to upgrade.

        - Changed module name to Mail::Valid as suggested
          by Kim Ryan.  People were having a difficult time
          locating it.
        - Added details() method to determine why an
          address check fails.  Thanks to Otis Gospodnetic
          for the suggestion.
        - Now requiring the Net::DNS module for DNS lookups
          for better error handling.
        - Global Net::DNS::Resolver object is now used for
          DNS queries.  Can be accessed directly to tweak
          the resolver behavior.
        - The address() method now returns an instance of
          the Mail::Address class rather than a string. 
          We're taking the time to construct the object, so
          why waste that effort?
        - Updated documentation

        - Added Mail::Address to PREREQ_PM to list
          dependency, as suggested by Achim.
        - Moved test.pl to t/valid.t as suggested by Achim.
        - DNS lookups now use Net::DNS if available, falling
          back to nslookup if not.  Suggested by
          Lupe Christoph.
        - Modified documentation
        - Renamed Email::Valid::NSLookup to Email::Valid::DNS,
          which is now responsible for all DNS queries.
